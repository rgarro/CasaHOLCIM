# CasaHOLCIM
A Prefab Concrete Tiles Home Project Sketched with Blender3D inspired on Sistema Prefa Holcim
I have found a House Plan from Costructora Santa Fe, since there are no 2.7m lenght Baldosas I patched
the livingroom front wall size with an extra column and a Holcim B0-0340.
I only used a BB0-1120 on the bathroom window. All the baldosas are Cargador type as a Tribute to Kowalsky , the last American hero to whom speed means freedom of the soul. The question is not when's he gonna stop, but who is gonna stop him.(Kowalsky construia sin permiso de construccion y la Municipalidad de Cisco le hecho el Bulldozer).
